# MiniRoyale2-SpeedHack
This is a BETA, and really a glitch. This will get patched pretty soon..

This is just a glitch that I made in python so you can run pretty fast and run through blocks.

If you want to repeat the script over and over (dangerous in one map, you'll be stuck.)

'''def test_func():
    # put the code here

for i in range(3):
    test_func()'''
    
    Adjust (3) to the amount of times you want the script to be repeated.
    
    Enjoy before patch.
